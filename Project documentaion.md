# Call center trends 

During my virtual internship with PwC Switzerland, I undertook a data visualization project using Power BI to analyze agent and customer behavior for PhoneNow, a telecommunications company. Collaborating directly with the company's manager, I transformed raw data into actionable insights, enabling data-driven decision-making to optimize operational efficiency and enhance customer experience. This project not only strengthened my expertise in data analysis and visualization but also demonstrated my ability to deliver impactful solutions in a professional setting.

Key stakeholder:

The call center manager, Phonenow.

###  Data source
The data was provided as part of the virtual internship program on forage, it's an excel file with 12 columns and 5000 unique rows.

### Data cleaning and preparation
I downloaded the dataset and imported it into Microsoft excel through power query.
on power query, i checked for these;

1. I removed Duplicate rows.
2. I also checked if all the columns are in their correct data type.
3. I dropped down each column to see if there are any inconsistencies in the spellings of the records.
4. I restructured the average talk duration into minutes for the purpose of analysis.

after cleaning the data with Microsoft Excel,I imported the cleaned data into Microsoft Power Bi for visualization.

## Key research questions
1. What are the number of calls answered and also the number of calls abandoned?
2. What's overall customer satisfaction?
3. which time of the day does the comapny receive most calls?

## RECOMMENDATIONS
1. Develop training programmes targeted at equiping the agents with the necessary skills to solve issues related to streaming, technical support, and payment since they were the most reported. This will reduce the number of issues related to these topics, ensuring smooth delivery of service.
2. Analyze the martha's attitude towards work and share it with the team since she was the most rated agent. This will boost overall customer satisfaction. on the other hand, Martha should be awarded as the best agent of the season, this will incentivize the other agents to work hard, driving productivity and improving overall customer satisfaction.
3. During the hours between 9 AM and 5 PM, the number of agents should be increased to reduce the number of calls abandoned.
4. unresolved issues should be addressed, the comapny may set up a special team to look into these issues and come up with solutions as early as possible, this will boost customers confidence in the company, Thereby improving the growth of the comapny and reducing customer churn.
